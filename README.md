# shut-the-box
This is a web version of the single player variation of (Shut the Box)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box].

## Rules
If 7, 8, and 9 are all flipped, the player may choose between rolling one or two dice. Otherwise, they must roll both.

Once the dice are rolled, total the value and then "shut" any of the open numbers that sum to the total value. For example, if the total is 8:
- 8
- 7, 1
- 6, 2
- 5, 3
- 5, 2 ,1
- 4, 3, 1

Re-roll until either it's not possible to reach the total (losing the game) or all of the tiles are flipped (winning the game)
